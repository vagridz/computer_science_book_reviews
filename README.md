# Computer Science Personal Learning Roadmap

This repository contains my personal "roadmap" to learn different computer
science topics.

As I tend to spend too much time on searching for the perfect resources or to
glance at many books/videos on a specific topic (in an attempt to find the
best), I decided to select only one item for each topic and stick to it before
starting a new one.

I will break this one item rule immediately in two ways:

- One video and one book per topic (so it's really two items);
- One (and only one) bonus item is possible.

This "roadmap" might not be the best way - might not even be a good one. It's
definitely bias against "front-end" development, due to personal preference.

This must be viewed as a kind of logbook for myself. I will try to put notes
and reviews to help people who might be interested in the same resources.
